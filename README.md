# Pitbull Smart Contract Code
Pitbull is a self-staking token that had its ownership renounced and given to the community upon its creation. This decentralization of power has allowed Pitbull to flourish as a 100% community-driven project that receives markedly engaged holders and rapid growth on a daily basis. It has become a unique social experiment in which the investors are integrated into the project both from a community and developmental standpoint.

Released March 17, 2021 on the Binance Smart Chain network, the Pitbull project has been iteratively built and improved upon by volunteers within the community since its inception. Graphic designers, writers, web developers, influencers, marketers, data analysts, translators, and more have contributed their talents to help Pitbull grow into an inspirational model of community-driven success.

With so much progress achieved by its community in such a short amount of time, Pitbull stands as a solid milestone in this progressive, exciting age of the Social Blockchain.
